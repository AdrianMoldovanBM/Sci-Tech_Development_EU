# Sci-Tech development in the European Union from 2023 - 2013

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the development of Science and Technology across European Union countries over the last 10 years, utilizing data sourced from the World Bank. The dataset was rigorously cleaned and transformed to extract meaningful insights, focusing on identifying the leading nations in the advancement of the Sci-Tech sector.

Using Python, I applied descriptive statistics to summarize the data and performed advanced visualizations, including boxplots to detect outliers, correlation graphs to explore relationships between variables, and scatterplots to highlight significant correlations. This analysis provided a clear view of the technological landscape in the EU, spotlighting key trends and top-performing countries in the Sci-Tech era.

Germany is the leading country when it comes to High-Technology exports, leading by far with over 180 billion dollars in exports every year. The highest value of 214 billion dollars was registered in 2014. 

Ireland stands at the forefront of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) service exports with a total of more than 40% of the BoP, with values ranging from 50 to 70 billion dollars every year.

The correlation graph shows a significant close relationship between the number of researchers in R&D and the level of research and development investments.

In countries with a large number of researchers, we also find many technicians in R&D fields, which of course are closely related to how much a country invests in development.

High Technology exports are also correlated with the number of scientific and technical journal articles published every year. Countries with a large number of publications have more HT exports.
